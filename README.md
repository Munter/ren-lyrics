# Ren lyrics repository

Welcome to the community project that collects Ren's lyrics.
We gather all the lyrics from all Ren's songs, translate them into the languages we like
and work to create good subtitle files for the YouTube videos

## Lyrics

Original english lyrics are placed in `src/lyrics`.

These are the original english lyrics, which serve as source material for translations.

## Subtitles

Original english subtitles are placed in `src/subtitles`.

Subtitle files are in the SubRip (.srt) format. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip

You can create `.srt` files with any SubRip supporting editor and create a pull request to this repository.

The subtitles in `src/subtitles` serve as the translation source for other traget languages

## Translations to other languages

Translations to other languages are coordinated on the Crowdin project [renmaskesmusic](https://crowdin.com/project/renmakesmusic). It is a public project where everyone can contribute translations.

If you'd like to contribute to translations, create an account, choose your language and see if any translations are missing.

If your target language is missing we are happy to add it for you to start translations to it. [Add an issue here to ask for a new language to be added](https://github.com/Munter/ren-lyrics/issues)


The github project will contain regular exports of the translations from Crowdin, and can thus be used as an offline mirror with files that are directly accessible in your own file system.
