London City, far from pretty
Two, zero, zero, five
A lady down in Paddington
Is fighting just to stay alive
Rhythmic beeps and blood stained sheets
Our lady weeps; she’s tired and frail
To set the scene
We must rewind the hands of time for violets tale

Violet was a silent girl
Grew up with violent starts
Her mother was a drinker
And her father was a bastard
Every night he’d tuck her tight
But never left the room
Ill spare you of the things he did
Im sure her mother knew

Violet was a silent girl
She moved out at sixteen
A semi-detached council flat
Paid for by a welfare-scheme
Packing shelves at Tesco’s
Stacking jars like pickled bricks
She met a boy named Stevie
And he was a little prick

Violet was a silent girl
And violet she fell fast
See Stevie was a wrongun
But he sure knew how to charm her
Every night he’d tuck her tight
But never left the room
History repeats itself
Hed paint her black and blue and ah...

She never stood a chance
The devil comes to dance

"Violet, why you always so silent?"
knock knock knock
On her bedroom door and he’s irate
He’s been drinking and smoking he’s up late
And he stands by her bedside, she shakes
But her eyes stay shut
"You fucking slut! I know you’re up!"
and he pinches her eyelids and folds them up
"Violet, why you lying to me violet?"
She stays silent, things turn violent

Knock knock knock

Thats the sound of his fists when they fall like a crashing pilot
Hit like hailstones, one to the collar bone, full force, full blown,
blood splat, bone crack, knick-knack-paddy-whack
one to the jaw and a tooth spat - detached
fist connects and disconnects the bone
a quick deflect to misdirect the blow
But non-the-less his punches met her throat
such a mess; he’s left her bruised and broke

"Violet!?
Why you always so silent violet!? Why you such a little liar violet!?
Do you think I want to do this Violet?!"

In character she stays silent

"Well say something Violet!"

Silence

"Fucking say something Violet!"

Silence...

"Wait... say something Violet"

Not one word, she stays quiet...

London City, far from pretty
two, zero, zero, five
A lady rushed to paddington is fighting just to stay alive
the doctor in a state of shock, saw something here so very wrong
See Violet, she was pregnant,
Poor violet, she was nine months gone

Turning to the doctor Violet broke her silence and she cried,
"If im to die right here tonight, please let my baby stay alive
"the doctor soon regained composure, called the surgeon to come in
As violets world turned to black, the curtains closed
The lights went dim in...

London City, far from pretty,
two zero zero five
A lady down in paddington
Just lost the fight to stay alive
A tragedy, or miracle
It happened on these very streets
Two twins are lying side by side

A girl named Jenny

And a boy named Screech
