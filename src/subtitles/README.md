# Creating subtitles

Creating good subtitles consists of much more than just finding timing offsets for lines of text.

Limitations:
- Stick to maximum two lines visible at a time
- Stay below 40 characters per line to reduce eye travel
- Stay below 25 characters per second to ease reading
- If there are multiple sets of captions back-to-back, avoid small gaps of a few milliseconds to reduce the annoyance of blinking
