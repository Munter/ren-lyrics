00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:19.775
<i>Hi there Ren.</i>

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.455
<i>It’s been a little while.
Did you miss me?</i>

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.859
<i>You thought you’d buried me, didn’t you?
Risky, because I always come back.</i>

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:25.876
<i>Deep down you know that...</i>

00:01:25.901 --> 00:01:27.815
<i>Deep down you know
I’m always in periphery</i>.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.054
<i>Ren, aren’t you pleased
to see me?</i>

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:31.398
<i>It’s been weeks since we spoke.
Bro, I know you need me.</i>

00:01:31.423 --> 00:01:33.446
<i>You’re the sheep, I’m the shepherd,
not your place to lead me.</i>

00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:35.676
<i>Not your place to be biting off
the hand that feeds me.</i>

00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:36.584
- Hi Ren.

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:38.600
I’ve been taking some time
to be distant.

00:01:38.732 --> 00:01:40.611
I’ve been taking some time
to be still.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.968
I’ve been taking some time to be by myself
since my therapist told me I’m ill.

00:01:45.085 --> 00:01:49.366
I’ve been making some progress lately,
and I’ve learnt some new coping skills.

00:01:49.426 --> 00:01:51.477
So I haven’t really
needed you much man.

00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:53.551
I think we need to
just step back and chill.

00:01:53.576 --> 00:01:55.490
<i>- Ren, you sound more insane
than I do.</i>

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:57.815
<i>You think that those doctors
are really there to guide you?</i>

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.265
<i>Been through this
a million times:</i>

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.975
<i>Your civilian mind is so perfect
at always being lied to.</i>

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.600
<i>Okay, take another pill boy.
Drown yourself in the sound of white noise.</i>

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:07.695
<i>Follow this 10 step program.
Rejoice!</i>

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.960
<i>All your problems will be gone.
Fucking dumb boy!</i>

00:02:10.011 --> 00:02:12.669
- Nah mate, this time it’s different man.
Trust me.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.986
I feel like things might
be falling in place.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.188
And my music’s been kinda doing bits too.
Like I actually might do something great.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.500
And when I’m gone maybe I’ll be remembered
for doing something special with myself.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.701
That’s why I don’t think
that we should talk man.

00:02:25.726 --> 00:02:27.681
Cause when your with me
it never seems to help.

00:02:27.706 --> 00:02:29.195
<i>- You think that you can
amputate me?</i>

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.415
<i>I am you, you are me,
you are I, I am we.</i>

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.535
<i>We are one, split in two.
That makes one, so you see:</i>

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.575
<i>You got to kill you
if you wanna kill me.</i>

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.815
<i>I’m not leftover dinner.
I’m not scraps on the side.</i>

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.712
<i>Oh, your music is thriving?
Delusional guy!</i>

00:02:39.737 --> 00:02:42.155
<i>Where’s your top ten hit?
Where’s your interview with Oprah?</i>

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.440
<i>Where are your Grammys, Ren?
Nowhere!</i>

00:02:44.465 --> 00:02:47.095
- Yeah but, my music’s not
commercial like that.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.255
I never chased numbers,
statistics or stats.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.895
I never write hooks
for the radio,

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.775
They never even play me, so
why would I concern myself with that?

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.095
But my music is really connecting
and the people who find it respect it.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.294
And for me that’s enough,
cause this life’s been tough,

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.255
so it gives me a
purpose I can rest in.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.095
<i>- Man, you sound
so pretentious!</i>

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.095
<i>Ren, your music is
so self-centred.</i>

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.735
<i>No one wants to hear another song about
how much you hate yourself, trust me.</i>

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.385
<i>You should be so lucky:
Having me inside you to guide you.</i>

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.990
<i>Remind you to manage expectations,
provide you perspective.</i>

00:03:15.015 --> 00:03:16.657
<i>That thing you neglected,
I get it:</i>

00:03:16.682 --> 00:03:19.471
<i>You wana be a big deal, next Jimi Hendrix?
Forget it!</i>

00:03:19.613 --> 00:03:20.703
- Man it’s not like that.

00:03:20.728 --> 00:03:22.870
<i>- Man it’s just like that.
I’m inside you, you twat!</i>

00:03:22.895 --> 00:03:25.009
- No it’s not man, you’re wrong,
when I write I belong.

00:03:25.034 --> 00:03:27.375
<i>- Let me break the fourth wall
by acknowledging this song:</i>

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.565
<i>Ren sits down,
has a stroke of genius:</i>

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.625
<i>He wants to write a song
that was not done previous:</i>

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.735
<i>A battle with his subconscious.
Eminem did it.</i>

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.840
- Played on guitar.
<i>- Plan B did it.</i>

00:03:35.865 --> 00:03:37.965
<i>Man you’re not original
you criminal rip off artist.</i>

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.509
<i>The pinnacle of your success is
stealing other people’s material.</i>

00:03:40.534 --> 00:03:41.994
<i>Ren mate, we’ve
heard it all before.</i>

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.215
<i>Oh, "She sells sea shells on the sea shore".</i>

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.215
- Fuck you! I don’t need you.
I don’t need to hear this.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.294
Cause I’m fine by myself.
I’m a genius!

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.272
and I will be great, and I will make waves,
and I’ll shake up the whole world beneath us.

00:03:53.297 --> 00:03:56.715
<i>- That’s right, speak your truth.
Your fucking god complex leaks out of you.</i>

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.855
<i>It’s refreshing to actually hear you say it
instead of down play it:</i>

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.737
<i>“Oh, music is all about
the creative process...</i>

00:04:02.762 --> 00:04:06.400
<i>and if people can find something to relate to
within that then that’s just a bonus”.</i>

00:04:06.443 --> 00:04:08.304
- Fuck you!
I’m ’a fucking kill you Ren.

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:10.463
<i>- Well, fucking kill me then.
Let’s fucking have you, Ren.</i>

00:04:10.488 --> 00:04:12.629
- I’m ’a do it, watch me prove it.
Who are you to doubt my music?

00:04:12.654 --> 00:04:14.331
Cause I call the shots,
I choose if you die.

00:04:14.356 --> 00:04:16.335
Yeah, I call the shots and
so I choose who survives.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.949
I’ll tie you up in knots,
when I lock you inside.

00:04:22.063 --> 00:04:23.372
<i>- Newsflash:</i>

00:04:23.852 --> 00:04:26.540
<i>I was created at
the dawn of creation.</i>

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.020
<i>I am temptation.</i>

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.180
<i>I am the snake in Eden.</i>

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.180
<i>I am the reason for treason.</i>

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.500
<i>Beheading all Kings,
I am sin with no rhyme or reason.</i>

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.975
<i>Sun of the morning, Lucifer,
Antichrist, father of lies.</i>

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.604
<i>Mestophilies.
Truth in a blender.</i>

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:42.740
<i>Deceitful pretender.
The banished avenger.</i>

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.220
<i>The righteous surrender when
standing in front of my solar eclipse.</i>

00:04:46.245 --> 00:04:48.439
<i>My name it is stitched
to your lips so you see,</i>

00:04:48.464 --> 00:04:51.420
<i>I won’t bow to the will of
a mortal, feeble and normal.</i>

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.020
<i>You wana kill me?
I’m enteral, immortal.</i>

00:04:54.077 --> 00:04:58.060
<i>I live in every decision that catalysed chaos,
that causes division.</i>

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.660
<i>I live inside death,
the beginning of ends.</i>

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.580
<i>I am you, you are me,
I am you, Ren.</i>

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:23.131
- Hi Ren.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.343
I’ve been taking some time
to be distant.

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:27.580
I’ve been taking some time
to be still.

00:05:27.605 --> 00:05:32.415
I’ve been taking some time to be by myself
and I’ve spent half my life ill.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.180
But just as sure as
the tide starts turning,

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.460
Just as sure as
the night has dawn,

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.427
Just as sure as the rainfall soon runs dry
when you stand in the eye of the storm.

00:05:42.452 --> 00:05:44.980
I was made to be
tested and twisted.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.260
I was made to be
broken and beat.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.900
I was made by His hand, it’s all part of His plan
that I stand on my own two feet.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.300
And you know me,
my will is eternal.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.700
And you know me,
you’ve met me before.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.460
Face to with a beast I will rise from the east
and I’ll settle on the ocean floor.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.020
And I go by many names also:

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.180
Some people know me as hope.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.981
Some people know me as the voice that you hear
when you loosen the noose on the rope.

00:06:11.006 --> 00:06:13.275
And you know how I know
that I’ll prosper?

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.580
Cause I stand here beside you today.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.119
I have stood in the
flames that cremated

00:06:18.143 --> 00:06:20.445
my brain and I didn’t
once flinch or shake.

00:06:20.752 --> 00:06:25.363
So cower at the man I’ve become,
when I sing from the top of my lungs:

00:06:25.538 --> 00:06:30.473
That I won’t retire, I’ll stand in your fire,
inspire the meek to be strong.

00:06:30.498 --> 00:06:35.046
And when I am gone, I’ll rise
in the music that I left behind.

00:06:35.101 --> 00:06:37.449
Ferocious persistent,
immortal like you.

00:06:37.474 --> 00:06:40.474
We’re a coin with
two different sides.

00:07:35.754 --> 00:07:41.373
When I was 17 years old
I shouted out into an empty room,

00:07:41.452 --> 00:07:44.984
into a blank canvas, that I would
defeat the forces of evil.

00:07:45.096 --> 00:07:49.088
And for the next 10 years of my life
I suffered the consequences:

00:07:49.192 --> 00:07:53.350
With autoimmunity,
illness and psychosis.

00:07:53.882 --> 00:07:57.469
As I got older I realised
there were no real winners

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.023
and there were no real losers
in psychological warfare.

00:08:01.104 --> 00:08:04.818
But there were victims
and there were students.

00:08:04.945 --> 00:08:07.850
It wasn’t David versus Goliath,

00:08:07.897 --> 00:08:12.572
it’s was a pendulum eternally swaying
from the dark to the light.

00:08:12.906 --> 00:08:17.460
And the more intense the light shone,
the darker the shadow it cast.

00:08:18.985 --> 00:08:23.495
It was never a battle for me to win,
it was an eternal dance,

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.064
and like a dance, the more rigid
I became the harder it got.

00:08:27.144 --> 00:08:31.080
The more I cursed my clumsy
footsteps the more I struggled.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.480
And so I got older
and I learned to relax,

00:08:35.533 --> 00:08:39.440
and I learned to soften
and that dance got easier.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:48.110
It is this eternal dance that separates human beings
from angels, from demons, from gods.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:56.820
And I must not forget, we must not forget,
that we are human beings.
