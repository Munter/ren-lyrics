[Vocalization] Uh's

00:01:18,855 --> 00:01:19,855
Hi there Ren

3
00:01:19,855 --> 00:01:21,705
It's been a little while,
Did you miss me?

4
00:01:21,705 --> 00:01:24,985
You thought you’d buried me, didn't you?
Risky… Because I always come back

5
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:27,705
Deep down you know that…
Deep down you know I'm always in periphery

6
00:01:27,705 --> 00:01:29,145
Ren aren't you pleased to see me?

7
00:01:29,145 --> 00:01:31,235
it's been weeks since we spoke bro,
I know you need me

8
00:01:31,235 --> 00:01:33,295
You’re the sheep, I'm the shepherd
Not your place to lead me

9
00:01:33,295 --> 00:01:35,385
Not your place to be biting off
the hand that feeds me!
