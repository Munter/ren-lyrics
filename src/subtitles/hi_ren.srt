00:00:57,046 --> 00:01:01,724
[Vocalization] Uh's

2
00:01:18,855 --> 00:01:19,855
Hi there Ren

3
00:01:19,855 --> 00:01:21,705
It's been a little while,
Did you miss me?

4
00:01:21,705 --> 00:01:24,985
You thought you’d buried me, didn't you?
Risky… Because I always come back

5
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:27,705
Deep down you know that…
Deep down you know I'm always in periphery

6
00:01:27,705 --> 00:01:29,145
Ren aren't you pleased to see me?

7
00:01:29,145 --> 00:01:31,235
it's been weeks since we spoke bro,
I know you need me

8
00:01:31,235 --> 00:01:33,295
You’re the sheep, I'm the shepherd
Not your place to lead me

9
00:01:33,295 --> 00:01:35,555
Not your place to be biting off
the hand that feeds me!

10
00:01:35,565 --> 00:01:36,575
- Hi Ren

11
00:01:36,575 --> 00:01:40,525
I’ve been taking some time to be distant
I’ve been taking some time to be still

12
00:01:40,525 --> 00:01:44,875
I've been taking some time to be by myself
since my therapist told me I'm ill

13
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:49,295
And I've been making some progress lately,
and I've learnt some new coping skills

14
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:51,625
So I haven't really needed you much man

15
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:53,525
I think we need to just step back and chill

16
00:01:53,525 --> 00:01:55,625
- Ren, you sound more insane than I do

17
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,755
You think that those doctors
are really there to guide you?


18
00:01:57,755 --> 00:01:59,245
Been through this a million times

19
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:01,985
Your civilian mind is so
perfect at always being lied to

20
00:02:01,985 --> 00:02:05,685
Okay, take another pill boy
Drown yourself in the sound of white noise

21
00:02:05,655 --> 00:02:09,985
Follow this 10 step program, rejoice!
All your problems will be gone! Fucking dumb boy

22
00:02:09,985 --> 00:02:12,765
- Nah mate, this time it's
different man trust me

23
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:15,265
I feel like things might be falling in place
